## Hello, I'm Bijil ðŸ‘‹
I am a data engineer who specialise in building robust and scalable data products, empowering businesses to generate value from their data. Few years ago, after finishing my doctorate in chemical engineering, my passion for data and engineering has led me to starting my career as a data scientist which later evolved into data engineering.

## My Expertise
I specialise on building and maintaining modern data infrastructure, encompassing data ingestion, data modelling, data visualisation, and data governance. Furthermore, I also collaborate closely with other data professionals, including data analysts and data scientists, and place great emphasis on open communication with end users i.e. business leaders, stakeholders, and customers.

## My Approach
I consider myself to be a pragmatic engineer who is not afraid to fail and always willing to learn from my mistakes. In my role, I often have to make decisions that are both functional and cost-effective while keeping in mind that generating a positive ROI as early as possible is a win for everyone. I am a strong advocate for clean and efficient code, and I always aim to deliver high-quality solutions that exceed expectations.

## My Projects
Over the past few years, I have worked on a diverse range of projects, from small-scale applications to large enterprise solutions, across various sectors including retail, cybersecurity, marketing, and finance. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to collaborate with some amazing individuals on exciting initiatives. These include enterprise-scale migration of on-premises database to cloud, implementing and orchestrating analytics-ready data pipelines, and building generative AI pipelines for natural language processing, among others.

## My Goals
I am a firm believer in continuous learning and strive to keep up with the latest trends and advancements in data engineering. My goal is to broaden my knowledge and skills in data engineering by diving into new technologies and tackling challenging projects. I am excited about sharing my insights and experiences through my blogs.

## Let's Connect
I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Whether you're looking to hire or simply want to chat about technology, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to connecting with you!
