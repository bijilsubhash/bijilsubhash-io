## Hello, I'm Bijil 👋
I am a data engineer with 5+ years of experience building modern data platforms, empowering businesses to unlock value through scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems. After finishing my doctorate in chemical engineering, my passion for data and engineering led me to start my career as a data scientist, which later evolved into data engineering.

## What I Do
I am the founder of [NimbleStax](https://nimblestax.com), where I work as a fractional data engineer helping early-stage startups and mid-tier organisations build out their data platforms from the ground up. My work spans the full spectrum of the modern data stack - from ingestion and transformation to orchestration, governance, and infrastructure as code.

I specialise in designing and deploying end-to-end data platforms using tools like dbt, Dagster, dlt, BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, Terraform, and Python. Whether it is migrating off legacy infrastructure, building config-driven ingestion frameworks, or rolling out cost-effective architectures on GCP, AWS and Azure, I focus on delivering solutions that are maintainable, extensible, and built to last.

## My Approach
I consider myself to be a pragmatic engineer who is not afraid to fail and always willing to learn from my mistakes. I often have to make decisions that are both functional and cost-effective while keeping in mind that generating a positive ROI as early as possible is a win for everyone. I am a strong advocate for clean and efficient code, and I always aim to deliver high-quality solutions that exceed expectations.

## Background
Over the past few years, I have worked on a diverse range of projects, from early-stage startups to large enterprise solutions, across various sectors including energy, retail, cybersecurity, finance, and marketing. These include building event-driven architectures processing hundreds of millions of rows daily, enterprise-scale migrations from Teradata and Salesforce to cloud-native platforms, and deploying GenAI pipelines for natural language processing.

## Let's Connect
I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Whether you're looking for a fractional data engineer for your team or simply want to chat about technology, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to connecting with you!
