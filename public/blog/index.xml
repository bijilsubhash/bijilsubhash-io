      <description>Couple of months ago, I shared my initial experience with Data Load Tool (DLT). Since then, I have been building some projects with the help of their documentation and the active Slack community. The Python-first approach of DLT greatly appealed to me as a data engineer. Over the past two months, I’ve deepened my appreciation for idiomatic Python while exploring and applying several of DLT’s features, which I am m eager to leverage in real-world projects.</description>

      <description>I learnt about programming when I was in middle school as one of the mandatory subjects. A good chunk of my early exposure into programming had me writing recursive functions for calculating factorials or printing the fibonacci series in C++ and Java. Though I did reasonably well in an academic setting, my abysmal understanding of the underlying concepts as a result of rote learning led me to leaving it all behind until much later in graduate school where I had to start using Python for working with data.</description>

      <description>The first time I have heard about data lakehouse was 2.5 years ago at a conference. Back then, I was still at the university and most of the content of the day went over my head. Fast forward to 2024, I have since graduated and have been working as a data engineer for nearly 1.5 years now. Just over a month ago, I came across data lakehouse again as I was starting to get myself ready for some upcoming projects on it.</description>

      <description>By and large, there is no shortage of data products coming into the market. Below is a snapshot of 2024 Machine Learning, AI and Data landscape, which has 2011 logos in total. It is incredibly difficult to pinpoint what is good amongst all of this. However, every now and then, there is a team behind a product that attempts to do something different. This article is about one such tool that I believe has a strong case to make an impact in its category.</description>
