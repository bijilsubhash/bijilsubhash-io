      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier last week, dbt agent skills were released to augment the behaviour of your coding agents to follow some of the best practices that is expected of a collaborator in your dbt project. I have been using agents for coding at some capacity with mixed results, and truthfully given the amount of dbt work I engage in, I was waiting for some opinionated framework that can be used to enhance this new way of working. That&amp;rsquo;s why when dbt labs announced the reased last week, I was quite eager to try it out and share some of my early findings. I am not going to delve into the details of what is included in the release, which you can read in detail &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-agent-skills&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and instead focus on some of the result that came out of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
