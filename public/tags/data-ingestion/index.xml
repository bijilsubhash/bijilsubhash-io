      <description>Couple of months ago, I shared my initial experience with Data Load Tool (DLT). Since then, I have been building some small projects with the help of their documentation. I have also been engaging with their community in Slack who have been extremely helpful when it comes to resolving blockers that I encounter. I was drawn to DLT due to its Python-first approach when it comes to data engineering. In addition to developing a deeper sense of appreciation towards idiomatic Python, over the course of the last two months, I have had the opportunity to work with a handful of features in DLT, which I hope to leverage in some real-world projects in the near-future.</description>

It is incredibly difficult to pinpoint what is good amongst all of this. However, every now and then, there is a team behind a product that attempts to do something different. This article is about one such tool that I believe has a strong case to make an impact in its category.</description>
