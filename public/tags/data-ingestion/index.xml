      <description>&lt;p&gt;Couple of months ago, I&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bijilsubhash.io/blog/exploring-dlt-for-data-ingestion/&#34;&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; my&#xA;initial experience with Data Load Tool (DLT). Since then, I have built a few&#xA;projects with the help of their &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlthub.com/docs/intro&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;and an incredibly supportive Slack community. I was immediately drawn towards&#xA;DLT for its Python-first approach when it comes to building data pipelines. Over&#xA;the past two months, I’ve deepened my appreciation for idiomatic Python while&#xA;exploring and applying several of DLT’s features, which I am eager to leverage&#xA;in real-world projects. In this article, I’ll dive into some key DLT features&#xA;and the lessons learned from building data pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By and large, there is no shortage of data products coming into the market. Below is a snapshot of 2024 Machine Learning, AI and Data landscape, which has 2011 logos in total. It is incredibly difficult to pinpoint what is good amongst all of this. However, every now and then, there is a team behind a product that attempts to do something different. This article is about one such tool that I believe has a strong case to make an impact in its category.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
